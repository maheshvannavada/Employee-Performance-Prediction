# Employee Performance Prediction

This project aims to predict employee performance and adaptability to post-pandemic office culture using machine learning techniques. It leverages data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and supervised learning models to generate actionable insights for HR teams.

## Project Objectives
- Predict employee performance using historical and workplace behavior data.
- Analyze features affecting adaptability in hybrid and in-office work setups.
- Support data-driven decisions for employee engagement and team restructuring.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost, KNN, Naive Bayes
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Winsorization, 3R (Remove, Replace, Retain), StandardScaler

## Key Steps
1. Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and skewed distributions.
2. Feature Engineering: Encoding, scaling, and creating derived features.
3. EDA: Visualizing trends and distributions.
4. Model Training: Applied and compared KNN, Naive Bayes, and XGBoost.
5. Model Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix.

## Results
- XGBoost delivered the best accuracy and generalization performance.
- Insights helped understand the correlation between WFH experience and employee adaptability.
